# Scripts

A repo to collect simple, usually one-file, scripts. 

## Dependencies

All dependencies should be stated in `dependencies.txt`. You can install them
all with `pip install -r dependencies.txt`.

## lsg (ls-git)

This is a quick-fix script to solve the problem of quickly understanding the
state of a git repository. As far as I know, there is no quick and easy way to
list the git status of all the files in a single directory. I am sure there is
a much quicker and more elegant solution, but I was unable to find it. So
instead I have written this script to solve the problem.

## print_tex_elements

A script to help automate the process of finding elements 
(`\figure{thisIsTheElement}`) in `tex` documents. For an overview I wrote a
description [here](https://ga7g08.github.io/projects/)
