# lsg (ls-git)

This is a quick-fix script to solve the problem of quickly understanding the state of a git 
repository. As far as I know, there is no quick and easy way to list the git status of all
the files in a single directory. I am sure there is a much quicker and more elegant solution, 
but I was unable to find it. So instead I have written this script to solve the problem.
